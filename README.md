# BC Motor Vehicle Incident Analysis

This project accesses data from the Government of British Columbia
[catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset).

In particular we download and analyze 10 datasets that all involve fatalities
or injuries sustained from a motor vehicle incident.

### Hypotheses

The objectives of this analysis include investigating the following hypotheses:

- Has the number of fatalities and/or injuries sustained in motor vehicle
incidents in BC increased or decreased in the last decade?

- Has the trend (if present) been driven by any of the factors we have access
to in the data?

We investigate this using data on fatalities/injuries involving
drugs and alcohol, speeding, and distracted driving.
