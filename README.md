# BC Motor Vehicle Incident Analysis

### Identify Dataset

This project accesses data from the Government of British Columbia
[catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset).

In particular we download and analyze 8 datasets that all involve fatalities
or injuries sustained in a motor vehicle incident:

- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-fatalities-with-distraction-involvement
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-serious-injuries-with-distraction-involvement
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-serious-injuries-by-role
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-serious-injuries-with-speeding-involvement
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-fatalities-with-speeding-involvement
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-fatalities-by-role
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-serious-injuries-with-alcohol-and-or-drug-involvement
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-fatalities-with-alcohol-and-or-drug-involvement

### Question

The objectives of this analysis include investigating the following questions:

- Has the number of fatalities and/or injuries sustained in motor vehicle
incidents in BC increased or decreased in the last decade?

- Has the trend (if present) been driven by any of the factors we have access
to in the data?

### Hypotheses

The objectives of this analysis include investigating the following hypotheses
about the above questions:

- We posit that the number of injuries/fatalities resulting from motor vehicle
incidents has declined over tha last decade.

- We posit the downward trend is caused by drop in all causes *except*
distracted driving.

We investigate this using data on fatalities/injuries involving
drugs and alcohol, speeding, and distracted driving.

### Plan of action

We will plot the overall number of injuries and fatalities against time for
previous decade.

We will plot the aggregated data from the last ten years in such a way as
to illustrate which causes have become more frequent and which have become
less frequent.
